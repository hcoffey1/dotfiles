Did windows update and nuke your boot loader but its still kinda your fault cause you placed it on their boot partition?

Well here is the simple fix:

Get arch boot medium loaded,

Mount root onto /mnt, then do:

mount --rbind --make-rslave /dev /mnt/dev
mount --rbind --make-rslave /sys /mnt/sys
mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc

chroot into /mnt

Run refind-install

Should be good to go

May want to remove /efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/icons-backup and refind.conf-sample
